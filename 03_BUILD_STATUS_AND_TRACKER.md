# 3. BUILD STATUS AND TRACKER

## Status definitions
- `NOT_STARTED`: no implementation evidence supplied.
- `IN_PROGRESS`: implementation is underway; not accepted.
- `BLOCKED`: requires missing input, decision, dependency, or access.
- `READY_FOR_REVIEW`: code and test evidence supplied, awaiting compliance review.
- `DONE`: implementation inspected and relevant acceptance tests passed.
- `REJECTED`: does not comply; fix before proceeding.
- `NOT_APPLICABLE`: explicitly approved as not applicable.

## Verified status at package creation
No app source repository or implementation code was provided for audit in this conversation. The uploaded planning material described the AI Provider & Model Manager, not a verified completed application. Thus no app feature can honestly be marked `DONE` yet.

## Rules
- Do not infer progress from a plan, mockup, or generated explanation.
- A generated file is not verified until inspected.
- A test is not passed unless its actual output/evidence is provided.
- Never mark a whole phase `DONE` when only part of it passed.
- Keep blocked items explicit.
