### LOG-006: Candidate Script Editing, Rollback Protection, Automated Downstream Pipeline, Model Diagnostics
- Date: 2026-10-29
- Scope: Implementation of candidate script editing with validation and rollback preservation (T-016), script overwriting without history (T-017), script edit approval revocation and downstream re-locking (T-018), one-click downstream pipeline orchestration (Skills B, C, D), AI provider capability catalog and connection diagnostics (T-023), and project model selection (T-025).
- Affected files:
  - `server.ts`: Added `PUT /api/projects/:id/script/edit` (candidate validator with strict preservation on error), `POST /api/projects/:id/pipeline/run` (gated multi-skill automated orchestrator), `GET /api/models/catalog` (verified capability matrix), `POST /api/models/test-connection` (live Gemini probe), `PUT /api/projects/:id/model-settings`.
  - `src/services/gemini.ts`: Added `MODEL_CATALOG` metadata and `testGeminiConnection()` latency/health diagnostic probe.
  - `src/App.tsx`: Added interactive Candidate Script Editor panel (part-by-part voiceover, visual scene, on-screen text, duration sum checker, error feedback), "Run Full Pipeline (Skills B, C, D)" button, live Provider Diagnostic test card with roundtrip latency reporting, and Project Preferred Model selector.
  - `tests/verify_acceptance.ts`: Extended acceptance test suite with automated verification for T-016, T-017, T-018, T-023, and T-025.
- Acceptance test evidence:
  - `npm test`: 24/24 tests passed (100% success rate).
  - T-016 verified: Invalid candidate returns 400 and preserves existing script v1 intact.
  - T-017 verified: Valid candidate overwrites script with v2; no historical drift.
  - T-018 verified: Candidate replacement resets `script_approved` to false and re-locks Skill B, C, D with 403.
  - T-023 verified: Model catalog lists verified Gemini models; connection test returns status 200.
  - T-025 verified: Model settings update and persist preferred model configuration.
- Plan deviations: None.
- Security/regression notes: Zero API key leakage; server-side vaulting verified; strict 6-project cap and downstream approval locks enforced.
- ChatGPT verdict: PASS / READY FOR REVIEW
- Tracker status updated: YES (TASK-005 marked DONE)

### LOG-007: Screen 9 Usage & History, Telemetry, and Permission-Gated Fallback Flow
- Date: 2026-10-29
- Scope: Implementation of Screen 9 Usage & History (08_UI_UX_SPEC.md §9), sanitized AI execution telemetry and honest cost estimation mode ("Estimate" / "Unknown", T-030), and permission-gated alternative model fallback flow forbidding silent swapping (Rule D-025, T-026).
- Affected files:
  - `server.ts`: Added `AIExecutionRecord` schema, `aiExecutionsStore`, `GET /api/executions` with honest usage aggregates, `POST /api/projects/:id/fallback/trigger-simulation` (simulating 429), and `POST /api/projects/:id/fallback/decide` (operator authorization gate).
  - `src/App.tsx`: Added dedicated "Usage & History" screen with 4 metric cards, skill & status filters, execution card feed, interactive Fallback Gate test button, and Fallback Authorization Banner.
  - `tests/verify_acceptance.ts`: Added acceptance tests for T-026 and T-030.
- Acceptance test evidence:
  - `npm test`: 26/26 tests passed (100% success rate).
  - T-026 verified: Silent model swapping strictly prevented; refusal preserves state; approval runs alternative model under audit.
  - T-030 verified: Cost display explicitly labeled `Estimate` rather than claiming exact billing invoice.
- Plan deviations: None.
- Security/regression notes: Zero API credential leakage; telemetry sanitized; project deletion purges linked execution records.
- ChatGPT verdict: PASS / READY FOR REVIEW
- Tracker status updated: YES (TASK-006 marked DONE)

### LOG-008: Screen 10 Project Settings & Retention, Section 6.2 Staleness Rules, Deletion Guard, and Canvas Node Inspector
- Date: 2026-10-29
- Scope: Implementation of Screen 10 Project Settings & Retention (08_UI_UX_SPEC.md §10, 06_DATA_MODEL_AND_LIFECYCLE.md §Staleness rules), Section 6.2 Staleness Rules enforcement, safe permanent deletion guard with typed-title confirmation (T-006, T-038), retention policy & transient cache purge (T-032, T-039), and interactive Workflow Canvas Node Inspector (08_UI_UX_SPEC.md §8).
- Affected files:
  - `server.ts`: Added `retention_policy` and `auto_cleanup_temp_files` to Project interface; updated `DELETE /api/projects/:id` with optional `confirm_name` verification; added `PUT /api/projects/:id/settings` with Section 6.2 staleness checks (revoking script approval and clearing downstream outputs on aspect ratio, duration, or language modifications); added `POST /api/projects/:id/cleanup-temp`.
  - `src/App.tsx`: Added Project Settings tab in navigation bar; built complete Screen 10 with video specifications, live staleness warning banner, retention policy selector, transient cache purge button, and typed-name deletion guard; upgraded Workflow Canvas to 6 full-stage pipeline nodes with interactive "Inspect Node" drawers displaying live execution state, runtime inputs, AI model security, real output previews, and telemetry.
  - `tests/verify_acceptance.ts`: Added automated acceptance tests for T-036 (settings update), T-037 (Section 6.2 staleness rules enforcement), T-038 (permanent deletion guard with typed confirmation), and T-039 (retention cleanup endpoint).
- Acceptance test evidence:
  - `npm test`: 30/30 tests passed (100% success rate).
  - T-036 verified: Settings update without spec staleness succeeds (200, `staleness_invalidated: false`).
  - T-037 verified: Duration change (32s -> 48s) revokes script approval (`script_approved: false`) and returns `script_approval_revoked`.
  - T-038 verified: Deletion with mismatched title rejected 400 (`CONFIRMATION_MISMATCH`); matching title deletes permanently (200).
  - T-039 verified: Retention purge endpoint cleans transient records under active policy.
- Plan deviations: None.
- Security/regression notes: All sensitive credentials remain server-side vaulted; typed-name deletion protects against accidental loss.

- Date: 2026-10-29
- Scope: Phase 9 Final Release Gate implementation satisfying all acceptance criteria in 09_TEST_AND_ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX.md and 11_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md.
- Key Deliverables & Verifications:
  1. Real AI skill execution & honest telemetry tracking with modern Google Gemini SDK (`@google/genai` TypeScript SDK on `gemini-3.8-flash`).
  2. Generation Origin Tagging & Transparency: Tagged all scripts and skill outputs as `ai_generated`, `operator_edited`, `sample_seed`, or `mock_fallback` with model, latency, and token metrics.
  3. UI Visual Badges: Added `GenerationBadge` across all screens (Script Studio parts, Skill Control Center cards, and Workflow Canvas Node Inspector).
  4. High-Fidelity Fallback Engine: Deterministic fallback generators adhering strictly to frozen contracts, preventing operator blockages while keeping telemetry and origin transparent.
  5. Fallback Prompt & Recovery Modal: Interactive modal providing transparent upstream API error notifications and one-click execution.
  6. In-App Deletion & Toast System: Replaced native `window.alert` and `window.confirm` with in-app deletion confirmation modal and floating toast notifications (`showToast`), ensuring strict AI Studio iframe compliance.
  7. Full Acceptance Test Suite Expansion: Added tests T-040 (origin tagging & telemetry), T-041 (complete user production workflow: intake -> script -> candidate edit -> approval -> downstream pipeline -> sanitized export), and T-042 (AI execution telemetry & connection diagnostic logging).
- Affected files:
  - `server.ts`: Added telemetry recording to all skill endpoints; added deterministic fallback generators; added `generation_source`, `model_used`, `latency_ms`, and `tokens_used` to script and skill output records.
  - `src/App.tsx`: Wired `GenerationBadge` into Script Studio, Skill Control Center, and Workflow Canvas drawer; added in-app toast notification system and project deletion confirmation modal; wired fallback prompt recovery modal.
  - `src/services/gemini.ts`: Added latency tracking and explicit HTTP 403 PERMISSION_DENIED classification.
  - `src/contracts/types.ts`: Added `ExecutionMetadata` and model/telemetry fields to all skill input and output interfaces.
  - `src/services/skills/*`: Wired model selection and execution metadata tracking through all 4 skills.
  - `tests/verify_acceptance.ts`: Added tests T-040, T-041, T-042.
- Acceptance test evidence:
  - `npm test`: 33/33 tests passed (100% success rate).
  - `lint_applet` (`tsc --noEmit`): 0 errors, 0 warnings.
  - `compile_applet` (`vite build`): Build succeeded cleanly.
  - T-040 verified: Scripts and skill outputs explicitly tag origin and model telemetry.
  - T-041 verified: Complete end-to-end user workflow runs seamlessly from source ingestion through candidate edit, approval gate, video prompts, thumbnail, SEO, to sanitized export without credentials leakage.
  - T-042 verified: Diagnostic pings and skill executions accurately log execution records with latency and token metrics.
- Plan deviations: None. All frozen contracts, project rules, approval gates, and architectural constraints strictly preserved.
- Security/regression notes: All secrets server-side vaulted; all export bundles sanitized. Zero mock-as-real masquerading.
- ChatGPT verdict: PASS / RELEASE READY
- Tracker status updated: YES (TASK-008 marked DONE; Phase 9 marked DONE)
